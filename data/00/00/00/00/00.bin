  |   family-friendly play with the magic of VR gaming, and includes        |
  |   programming tools you can use to create your very own VR games and    |
  |   experiences! Just add your Nintendo Switch console and its Joy-Con    |
  |   controllers to feel your creations come to life as you and your       |
  |   family blast through an alien invasion, create 3D works of art,       |
  |   dive into an oceanic photo safari, soar atop a bird, and go           |
  |   wherever else your imagination takes you. There's more for you and    |
  |   your family to make, play, and discover together than ever before.    |
  |   All required materials are included, and the packed-in software       |
  |   provides interactive build instructions, quick-play VR games, and     |
  |   more. Get ready for hours of engaging, inspiring, and enriching DIY   |
  |   family fun!                                                           |

  |   controllers called Toy-Con, and then use your creations to play the   |
  |   software's variety of fun, immersive games. Sharing the fun is as     |
  |   easy as passing Toy-Con creations from one player to the next;        |
  |   there's no head strap or complicated equipment to get in your way.    |
  |   Interacting with creations translates into in-game actions to         |
  |   create a truly immersive experience - from firing your Blaster to     |
  |   flapping your Bird's wings - and each creation enhances the sense     |
  |   of immersion with real-world sensations like movement resistance,     |
  |   sounds, and gusts of wind. Discover how your creations work with      |
  |   the Nintendo Switch technology through handy tutorials, and when      |
  |   you're ready to try making something uniquely yours, use the          |
